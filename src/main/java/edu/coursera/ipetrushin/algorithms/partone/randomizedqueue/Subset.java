/**
 * Write a client program Subset.java that takes a command-line integer k;
 * reads in a sequence of N strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints out exactly k of them, uniformly at random.
 * Each item from the sequence can be printed out at most once. You may assume that 0 ? k ? N,
 * where N is the number of string on standard input.
 *
 *
 * The running time of Subset must be linear in the size of the input.
 * You may use only a constant amount of memory plus either one Deque or RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most N,
 * where N is the number of strings on standard input.
 *
 * (For an extra challenge, use only one Deque or RandomizedQueue object of maximum size at most k.)
